        A palindrome is a word, phrase, number, or sequence of characters that reads 
        the same backward as forward, ignoring spaces, punctuation, and capitalization. 
        For example: Words: "radar," "level," "madam" Phrases: "A man, a plan, a canal, 
        Panama" Numbers: 121, 1221, 12321 Palindromes are fascinating because they exhibit 
        symmetry, and they are often used as puzzles or challenges in coding and linguistics.
